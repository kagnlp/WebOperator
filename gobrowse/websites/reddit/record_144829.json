I had felt a little crazy over the last week or so. First all those strange notes I had been leaving myself, and then last night. Today, in the daylight, it seemed ludicrous.

My eyes were drawn back to the occasional deviations from the white noise. What were they? They had happened long after I lost consciousness. Something about them unsettled me. I can’t say what exactly it was that gave me discomfort. Maybe there was something about the shape of the waveforms that I recognised. Or maybe I was remembering something I had forgotten.

Given that the page is already the submissions page and we encountered a 404 error, it's possible that the specific user 'GetFreeCash' does not have any submissions or the URL is incorrect. To verify this, I will check if there is a link to go back to the home page and attempt to navigate there. If the home page also shows a 404 error, we can conclude that the user 'GetFreeCash' does not have any submissions.",

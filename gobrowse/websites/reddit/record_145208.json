Given its niche nature, it proved pretty tricky to find full runs of the game, but eventually I was able to chase down a few longform speedrun playthroughs that had been uploaded to Youtube by some of the game’s previous world record holders.

I wasn’t sure exactly when it started, but at random points in the game, it felt like more and more dialogue boxes were coming up during character conversations. Generally, in a speedrun, you’re clicking through all of the dialogue boxes as fast and frequently as possible - after all, the point isn’t to experience the narrative and character conversations in full, the point is to power through the game in record time. The additional dialogue boxes were especially apparent during a major boss fight that took place at the midpoint of the game.

The group (or “party”) led by our fateful protagonist and reformed thief - we can call him “Knight” - loses this epic encounter every single run. It’s known as a “scripted battle”.

It was a bit of an uncomfortable experience to see a dialogue exchange that I couldn’t recall from previous playthroughs, from a game that I thought I knew inside out, but I was able to shake it off pretty quickly. The now defunct developers were known for throwing meta stuff into their games from time to time (another series they’d helmed for the original Playstation was actually quite famous for its meta narratives). And so, I decided to soothe myself with the most reasonable explanation I could think of. Clearly, through my speedrunning and experimenting, I’d accidentally triggered a hidden story route that was put into the game by the devs that had remained undiscovered until now. I’ll be honest and say that I didn’t buy this idea completely, but it was enough for me to get a good night’s sleep and not think about it too much. And what the hell, maybe I could see how this weird new story route played out during future runthroughs, in case it was something I could take advantage of to find a more optimized speedrunning route.'\n\t\t\t[171] paragraph ''\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'Over the next couple of days, I did my best to ignore all of the dialogue boxes, especially any that looked like they were new additions that hadn’t been there before.'\n\t\t\t[172] paragraph ''\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'There were a couple of odd moments that happened during this period.'\n\t\t\t[173] paragraph ''\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'Sometimes, the party would take a while to respond to action commands during battle (ex. Attack, Defend, Use Item, Flee, etc.). I’d have to press the button multiple times for them to take any sort of action. Other times, specifically during cutscenes and cinematics, it sort of felt like there were more characters in the background than usual. Most of the time, they were just sort of… there, lingering in the back, taking in the action, looking a bit out of place. And finally, weirdest of all, it sometimes felt like the 3D models of the main party looked kind of, for lack of a better term… worn out. They didn’t look as “peppy” as fantasy characters usually looked. I convinced myself that my eyes were just playing tricks on me. After all, speedrunning is the art of staring at a screen for many hours at a time doing the same thing over and over again. Maybe weird moments like these were just me playing mental tricks on myself.'\n\t\t\t[174] paragraph ''\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'A few months ago, I had an extra amount of spare time after work, so I booted up the game and started playing. For some reason, this time I had an immediate feeling of dread as soon as I did. I tried to shake it but…'\n\t\t\t[175] paragraph ''\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'As I went from the main menu screen to the file select menu, the name of my save file had changed.'\n\t\t\t[176] paragraph ''\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'It now read:'\n\t\t\t[177] paragraph ''\n\t\t\t\tStaticText '“HELLO”'\n\t\t\t[178] paragraph ''\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'Huh.'\n\t\t\t\t[179] emphasis ''\n\t\t\t\t\tStaticText 'Okay'\n\t\t\t\tStaticText '. After a slight shock reaction, I grounded myself back in reality.

Instead, it loaded on our Knight protagonist standing in a weird dungeon-like room I’d never ever seen before. As I went to control the Knight… he started walking on his own. Shit startled the hell out of me. I checked to see if I’d accidentally set my controller down on the sofa causing the analog stick to be stuck in some random position, but nope. I even unplugged the controller just to be safe. It didn’t change anything. I watched, nervous and confused, as the Knight walked through dark hallway after dark hallway. This went on for minutes.'\n\t\t\t[183] paragraph ''\n\t\t\t\tStaticText 'Eventually, he reached a long, dimly lit room where the other three main characters in the party were seated on different sides of a very long table.

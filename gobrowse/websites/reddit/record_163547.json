The error occurred after I clicked the 'Save' button to create the page.\n\nLooking at the navigation options, I can see a 'Go to home page' link. Since I encountered a server error, my first step should be to go back to the home page and try to navigate to the wiki section again. From there, I can attempt to create the index page once more.\n\nI'll click on the 'Go to home page' link to return to the main site.",

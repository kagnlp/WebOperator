This means the area I'm trying to export is too large according to the API's limits. The previous attempt to click the Export button timed out, likely because we're already seeing the API error response page rather than the export interface. To solve this issue, I need to inform the user about this limitation and suggest options to proceed.",

Please try again with a smaller area or use the planet.osm option for complete data.')"
